The Tiny Language Runtime (TLR) v0.1
====================================

This is a C project used in a C tutorial for GW's cs3411, Operating
Systems.

Very simple, switch statement-based interpreter for a simple
register-based language with memory access.  Future extensions include

- adding a stack pointer, function calls and returns, 
- integer multiplication/division
- string operations
- import and export of programs from files

Then you'll actually have a very real language runtime.  Layer syntax
on top and go!
